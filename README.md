https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp (chosen one)
This course here looks like exactly what I need. Apparently, it's a bootcamp that starts in 2026, but if I do it self-paced, I can do it alone. One part I liked is that it seems very current.

I had found this link here before, but apparently the link above is this same course, only updated and directly on github.

I found this guy here too. This is the public link, but within the platform, there are more specific project-based courses.
